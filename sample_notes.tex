This package should provide many commands and environments that the average student may want when taking notes in class. This includes color coding, highlighting, and emphasizing things in a consistent way.
\\
\\
You can highlight important things like this:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{important}
    Important stuff goes here!
\end{important}
\end{verbatim}

which would look like this:

\begin{important}
    Important stuff goes here!
\end{important}

Theorems and proofs are given ther own special highlighting, as follows. They can be made with
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thm}{name of theorem}
...
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
...
\end{proof}
\end{verbatim}
Here is a sample theorem box:
\begin{thm}{Theorem}

\end{thm}
And here is a sample proof box:
